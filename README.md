# Installation Script
This is my installation shell script.

# Tensorflow
Install tensorflow by running ```./tf-step1.sh``` and ```./tf-step2.sh```
The script installed ```tensorflow v1.0.0```, ```CUDA v8.0``` and ```cuDNN v5.1``` by default.
To install higher version of tensorflow, you may change the version number in the script.

### **IMPORTANT**
Though the latest CUDA version is 9.0, Tensorflow 1.4.0 only support CUDA v8.0.
